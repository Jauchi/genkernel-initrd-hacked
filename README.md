# genkernel-initrd-hacked
Hacked together version of genkernels initramfs. DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING!

# What is this?
If you come from the ZFS issue tracker, thank you for checking out my code. If you come from anywhere else, please turn around now.
This is nothing you will ever want to use or improve upon, instead use it as inspiration for code that is not as terrible.

All positive credit goes to the people over at genkernel, if you want to contribute, please do so there: https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/genkernel.git/

Anything that is bad and ugly probably is so because I put it there.

# So, nothing useful?
No, please use and contribute to genkernel instead!
